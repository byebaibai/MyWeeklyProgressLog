The is the MTM code written by Lees as published in:

Lees, J. M. and J. Park (1995): Multiple-taper spectral analysis: A stand-alone C-subroutine: 
Computers & Geology: 21, 199-236.


This has been upgraded and tested on numerous Linux and Unix machines.

To compile:

Un-tar the file in a directory 

type in:

make all

This creates an executable file in the local directory called testmt


to run the program, type in:


./testmt signal1 3 5 1 1

or,

./testmt O18.dat  3 5 1 1


for this program the data is read in as:

first line has number of points and delta-t
then the data follows in a long vector:

so, for example::

wadati% more  O18.dat
866 3.0
-2.22
-1.16
-1.00
-0.69
-0.56
-0.46
-0.73...etc....
