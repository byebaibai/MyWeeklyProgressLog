Modify the wavelet and filter settings (but keep the peak/center frequencies the same) 
until these two methods produce very similar results. 
Next, modify the wavelet and filter settings (except the peak/center frequencies) to make the results different 
(stay within a reasonable range of parameter settings; they do not need to look dramatically different). 
Which parameters did you change to make the results look more similar versus more different? 
How different are the results, and would you consider this a meaningful difference? 
What does this difference tell you about when to use specific parameter settings for wavelet convolution and 
the filter-Hilbert method?
