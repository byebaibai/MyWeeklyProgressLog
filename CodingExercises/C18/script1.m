    Select three frequency bands and compute time-varying power at 
    each electrode in these three bands, using either complex wavelet 
    convolution or filter-Hilbert. Compute and store both the baseline-corrected 
    power and the raw non-baseline-corrected power. You can choose which time period 
    and baseline normalization method to use.
