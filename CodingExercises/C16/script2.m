Next, compute a time-frequency map of signal-to-noise ratio. 
The signalto-noise ratio of power is discussed more in chapter 18, 
but it can be estimated as the average power at each time-frequency point across trials, 
divided by the standard deviation of power at each timefrequency point across trials.
