Make time-frequency plots of power and signal-to-noise ratio from the two methods. 
Make another plot in which you subtract the signal-to-noise plots between the two methods. 
Are there any noticeable differences between the signal-to-noise results when the multitaper method versus the short-time FFT is used?
