7. (Optional) Because phase values are circular (-ir and +ir are identical), 
most color maps are inappropriate because they suggest that - ir and +ir are very different values 
(represented, e.g., by blue and red colors). 
Create a circular colormap that can be used for phase values. 
You can do this by setting the red, green, and/or blue values to be a cosine function rather than a linear function. 
Recreate the phase topographical maps. Do they look any different with the new color maps?
